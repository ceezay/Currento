# Currento

Different countries use different currency, and there is daily variation in these currencies relative to one another. Those who transfer money from one country to another (one currency to another) must be updated with the latest currency exchange rates in the market.

Currento is built keeping this thing in mind. It is simply a calculator-like app developed using Ajax, Java servlets web features. In this application, there is regular update about currency of every country by which it displays present currency market value and conversion rate.

Such application can be used by any user, but it is mainly useful for business, shares, and finance related areas where money transfer and currency exchange takes place on a daily basis.

In this currency converter app, users are provided with an option to select the type of conversion, i.e. from “this” currency to “that” currency. This simple feature allows users to enter amount to be converted (say currency in Dollars), and display the converted amount (say currency in Euro).
